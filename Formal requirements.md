# Formal requirements of the IoMusT ontology

1. **Represent the concept of Musical Things, including:**
* (a) its type (e.g., musical instrument, wearable device, stage equipment);
* (b) its characteristics including the number and type of inputs (e.g., sensors tracking movements or biometric parameters) and outputs (e.g., auditory, visual, haptic, olfactory);
* (c) the type of person for which it is conceived (e.g., performer, audience member, live sound engineer, producer);
* (d) its function (e.g., a smart instrument used to produce musical content, a musical haptic wearable aiming at enriching the listenersâ€™ musical experience, an interface used by audience members for participatory purposes, a device used to infer the mood of audience members based on sensed quantities);
* (e) its geographical position;
* (f) the type of data that it generates (e.g., audio signal, text message);
2. **Represent the concept of connectivity, including:**
* (a) the type of network involved (e.g., local network, remote network, Wi-Fi-based, millimeter waves-based);
* (b) the attributes of the network (e.g., bandwidth, speed, synchronization mechanisms);
* (c) the time taken by the network to deliver/receive a message to/from a certain Musical Thing;
3. **Represent the concept of application and service, including:**
* (a) its purpose (e.g., for music learning, performance, composition, studio production)
* (b) its level of interactivity (e.g., interactive, non-interactive)
* (c) its type (e.g., social network, online music content repository)
* (d) its user (e.g., composer, performer, studio producer, educationalist, student, audience member)
4. **Describe attributes of the music (produced live) at a given time, including:**
* (a) low-level features (e.g., the density of notes);
* (b) high-level features (e.g., the mood)
5. **Describe attributes of the ecosystems, including:**
* (a) the number and type of Musical Things present in the network at a given time and a given space;
* (b) which Musical Things are interacting;
* (c) the number and type of applications and services available within the ecosystem;
* (d) the number and type of networks used at a given time.
