# MIRO report for the IoMusT ontology
We here report the documentation for the [IoMusT ontology](https://github.com/fr4ncidir/IoMusT/blob/master/iomust.owl) according to the guidelines available in [1].

## A. Basics
1. **Ontology name (MUST)**
Internet of Musical Things Ontology (IMTO), version 0.1

2. **Ontology owner (MUST)**
[Francesco Antoniazzi](https://github.com/fr4ncidir)

3. **Ontology license (MUST)**
[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/fr4ncidir/IoMusT/blob/master/LICENSE)

4. **Ontology URL (MUST)**
<https://github.com/fr4ncidir/IoMusT/blob/master/iomust.owl>

5. **Ontology repository (MUST)**
<https://github.com/fr4ncidir/IoMusT>

6. **Methodological framework (MUST)**
The ontology is defines the needed concepts to create a Musical Things IoT environment by introducing the namespaces _iot_ and _iomust_, and connecting them to well known ontologies like [SOSA](<https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/>) and [PROV-O](<https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/>).

## B. Motivation
1. **Need (MUST)**
The aim of the ontology is to explore a field of IoT that is rather new: the Internet of Musical Things. 

2. **Competition (MUST)**
At the moment, only with ontologies in IoT panorama. So far, no ontologies are available joining Music and IoT.

3. **Target audience (MUST)**
Developers of IoT applications applied to music.

## C. Scope, requirements, development community
1. **Scope and coverage (MUST)**
The ontology is defines the needed concepts to create a Musical Things IoT environment by introducing the namespaces _iot_ and _iomust_. The two namespaces are extended, by plugging in references to other well known ontologies, resulting in a complete vocabulary available to develop interoperable applications. 

2. **Development community (MUST)**
Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems (ARCES) of the University of Bologna.

3. **Communication (MUST)** [Issues](https://github.com/fr4ncidir/IoMusT/issues) on Github.

## D. Knowledge acquisition
1. **Knowledge acquisition method (MUST)**
Analysis of the available literature on Semantic Web, ontologies and IoT. In particular, how to represent music and music instruments, devices and their components.

2. **Source knowledge location (SHOULD)** None
3. **Content Selection (SHOULD)** 
Things, Musical Things, Smart Things, Wearable Things...
## E. Ontology content
1. **Knowledge representation language (MUST)**
OWL 2 generated by Protégé v5.5.0beta; however, the ontology is at this stage only descriptive, and
it uses a reduced subset of OWL 2 capabilities, being the Description Logic ALCRIF(D).

2. **Development environment (OPTIONAL)**
Protégé v5.5.0beta.

3. **Ontology metrics (SHOULD)**
Number of classes: 19; number of object properties: 11; number of data properties: 4; 0 individuals.
Inverse popularity

4. **Incorporation of other ontologies (MUST)**
For now, [SOSA](<https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/>), [PROV-O](<https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/>), [Music Ontology](<http://musicontology.com/specification/>), [Event Ontology](<http://motools.sourceforge.net/event/event.html>), [Timeline Ontology](<http://motools.sourceforge.net/timeline/timeline.html>), [FOAF](<http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/>)

5. **Entity naming convention (MUST)** 
Entities follows the CamelCase notation. Both datatype and object properties are named as verb senses with mixedCase notation.

6. **Identifier generation policy (MUST)**
Identifiers of the instances must be generated by the application

7. **Identity metadata policy (MUST)**
All entities have an rdfs:comment natural language explanation

8. **Upper ontology (MUST)** 
See point 4.

9. **Ontology relationships (MUST)**
11 object properties; 4 datatype properties.

10. **Axiom pattern (MUST)**
151 axioms included (of which 66 logical axioms, 37 declaration axioms, 10 SubClassOf, 6 EquivalentClasses, 1 DisjointClasses, 6 hidden GCI, 6 InverseObjectProperties, 2 FunctionalObjectProperties, 1 Inverse Functional, 4 Asymmetric Object Properties, 4 Irreflexive, 11 ObjectPropertyDomain and Range, 3 Functional DataProperty, 4 DP domain and range, 48 annotation assertions)

11. **Deferencable URI (OPTIONAL)** 
It is possible to use deferencable URIs, but no assumption on this is made in the ontology.
## F. Managing change
1. **Sustainability plan (MUST)**
Some research projects are being prepared to leverage the ontology.

2. **Entity deprecation strategy (MUST)**
Deprecated classes will be labelled as obsolete with a proper annotation property.

3. **Versioning policy (MUST)**
The IoMusT ontology adopts sequence-based identifiers for its versions with a major number and a minor number, separated by a dot. A novel release featuring only small changes will cause a switch of the minor number, while relevant and/or structural changes affects also the major number.

## G. Quality assurance
1. **Testing (MUST)**
Tests have been made by checking competency questions and formal requirements in the presentation paper. Once published, it will be available [here]().

2. **Evaluation (MUST)**
Metrics, and discussions over IoMust ontology evaluation have been discussed in the presentation paper.

3. **Examples of use (MUST)**
At the moment, only theoretical examples of usage in the presentation paper.

4. **Institutional endorsement (OPTIONAL)**
None

5. **Evidence of use (MUST)**
The ontology is still new, but we plan to use it in forthcoming projects.
